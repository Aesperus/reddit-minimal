# Reddit Minimal

## Description
Reddit Minimal is an academic practice project intended to simulate the
development of a real-world applicationâ€”from initial design through testing and
optimizations to deployment.

The application is a simple Reddit clone designed to use the Reddit .json API
 to retrieve and display popular posts and popular subreddits.

The application allows filtering of posts by a search term and subreddit.
